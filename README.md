# Voxelized bulk lunar surface bombarded by the 69-bin PAMELA cosmic ray proton spectrum in GEANT4
Reference: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.17419
* 69-bin PAMELA cosmic ray proton spectrum between 0.4 and 115 GeV.
* 3x2x3 m^3 Moon surface.
* Bulk density=1.93 g/cm^3.
* Voxelization via 100 cells of 2-cm thickness.
* Secondary neutron tracking atop the lunar surface as well as within the voxelization cells.
